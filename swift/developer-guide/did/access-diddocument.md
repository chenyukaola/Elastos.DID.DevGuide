# Access the DID Document

## 读取文档信息

Read the document

DIDDocument 主要是用来描述 DID 的密钥信息，以及 DID 需要公开的信息。常规而言 DID 文档包含的内容分为一下类别：

DIDDocument mainly describes the key information of DID and the information that DID needs to disclose. In general, the content of DID documents is divided into the following categories:

* Public Keys
  * Authentication keys
  * Authorization keys
* Controllers
* Multiple-Signature
* VeriableCredentials
* Services
* Expiration date
* Document proof

不同的 DID 可能使用这些属性的一个子集。其中 VeriableCredentials 是 Elastos DID 针对 W3C DID 的扩展。原则上 DID 文档中不应该包含任何个人信息，因为 DID 文档是公开的，一旦发布以后全世界都可以读取。但是对于一些公众实体，可能希望公开特定的实体信息，那么可以把包含实体信息的可验证凭证内嵌到 DID 文档中公开。

Different DIDs may use a subset of these attributes. The VeriableCredentials is Elastos DID’s extension of W3C DID. In principle, the DID document should not contain any personal information, because the DID document is public and can be read all over the world once it is published. However, since some public entities hope to disclose specific entity information, verifiable credentials containing entity information can be embedded into the DID document for disclosure.

DID 文档因为是 sealed 对象，由持有人的签名包含，所以 DIDDocument 是只读的，Swift 的 DIDDocument 实现提供了一系列的方法用来读取 DID 文档中包含的信息.

DIDDocument is read-only, because it is a sealed object included by the signature of the controller. Swift’s DIDDocument implementation provides a series of methods to read the information included in DIDDocument.

## 使用 DID 对数据进行签名和验证

Sign and verify data with DID

DID 对象除了表示身份并对身份进行验证外，也可以用于对应用数据进行签名和验证。

The DID object not only represents and verifies the identity, but also signs and verifies the application data.

### DID 持有人签名数据

Data about the signature of the DID controller

```
let store: DIDStore = ... // an opened DIDStore instance
let storePasswd = "secret";
let did = try DID("did:elastos:idFKwBpj3Buq3XbLAFqTy8LMAW8K7kp3Ab")
var data: Data  // the data to be sign and verify

// Get the existing DIDDocument
let doc = try store.loadDid(did)
let signature = try doc.sign(using: doc, for: data)
```

持有人可以把 data 和他的 DID 生成的数据签名一起交给第三方，那么第三方就可以验证数据和签名是否匹配。

The controller can submit the data and the digital signature generated by DID to a third party, and the third party can verify whether the data matches the signature.

### 第三方验证数据和签名

The third party verifies the data and signature

```
let did = try DID("did:elastos:iXyYFboFAd2d9VmfqSvppqg1XQxBtX9ea2") // signer‘s DID
var data: Data // the data to be verify
let signature: String // the signature signed by signer

let doc = try did.resolve()
if try doc.isValid() {
    let genuine = try doc.verify(signature: signature, onto: data)
} else {
    // Signer's DID is invalid, should report error.
}
```
