# Introduction

## DID

DID (Decentralized identifier) is a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

## Elastos DID

**Elastos DID (Decentralized Identifier) framework** is a set of APIs for Elastos DID that is compatible with W3C DIDs specs.

## Language support

Elastos DID SDK可提供多种语言支持：java，swift c，c/c++和javascript。

## EID side chain

Elastos DID runs on the Elastos Identity Chain (EID) based on ethereum chain and issues DIDs to any device and individual that needs a trust-based system, which is exactly what the SmartWeb is designed for.

## EID RPC service for DID SDK

Elastos采用[JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)接口提供DID和Verifiable Credentials解析方法。Elastos定义了在EID side chain上对DID和credential进行解析或者查询的接口规范。
