# Create DID and DIDDocument

The most basic object in the DID system is the DID object, which is the object identified by DID; DID document is the detailed content object of DID. This chapter explains the creation and modification of these two parts.

{% content-ref url="create-did.md" %}
[create-did.md](create-did.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="create-diddocument.md" %}
[create-diddocument.md](create-diddocument.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
