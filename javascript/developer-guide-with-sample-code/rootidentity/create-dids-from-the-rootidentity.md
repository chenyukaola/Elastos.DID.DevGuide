# Create DIDs from the RootIdentity

## Example

```typescript
let rootPath = "root/store";
let store = await DIDStore.open(rootPath);
... ... ... ...
let mnemonic = "pact reject sick voyage foster fence warm luggage cabbage any subject carbon";
let passphrase = "helloworld";
let identity = RootIdentity.createFromMnemonic(mnemonic, passphrase, store, "pwd");
let doc = await identity.newDid("pwd");
let did = identity.getDid(0);
if (doc && did) {
    console.log("new did {} successfully.", doc.getSubject());
    loadDoc = store.loadDid(doc.getSubject());
    if (loadDoc)
        console.log("new did {} is in the DID store.", doc.getSubject());
    else
        console.log("new did {} isn't in the DID store.", doc.getSubject());
    if (did.equals(doc.getSubject()))
        console.log("two dids are same.");
    else
        console.log("two dids aren't same");
} else if (doc == null) {
    console.log("new did failed.");
} else {
    console.log("get did failed.");
}
... ... ... ...
store.close();
```

## Usage

```typescript
public async newDid(
    storepass: string,
    index: number = undefined,
    overwrite = false
): Promise<DIDDocument>;\
```

RootIdentity generates a new DID, saves its DID document in the DID store, and returns DID document. It should be noted that this function does not need to provide a DID Store, which is provided by RootIdentity (generating RootIdentity is equivalent to recording its associated DID Store).

Overwrite indicates whether the existing DID needs to be overwritten. When overwrite is true, overwrite the existing DID and return the newly generated DID object; when overwrite is false, if the DID already exists, throw an exception and return NULL.

```typescript
public getDid(
    index: number
): DIDï¼›
```

GetDid is used to get DID objects, which will neither generate nor save DID document in the process. It's mainly used for users to obtain DID objects to perform other DID operations.
