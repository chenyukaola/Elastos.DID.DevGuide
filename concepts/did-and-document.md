# DID and Document

## DID

Elastos DID supports two DID formats. The first is primitive DID, which uses the ID sidechain address encoded by Bitcoin-style Base58 - the ID string is case-sensitive. The second is customized DID, which is also unique - this will be discussed in the next chapter.

Primitive DID is just an identifier which can be verified by cryptography. It's important to note that DID is a string, where the most fundamental aspect is the key system associated with this string. All related contents of DID are relevant to the identifier - that is, the corresponding contents (such as document and credential) can be found through the DID identifier.

## Document

DID Document承载了DID更详尽的信息，比如加密信息，验证方法，服务点等内容。DID在链上也是通过DID Document来表现的。

More detailed information of DID is carried by DID Document, such as encrypted information, verification methods and service points. Moreover, DID is represented by DID Document in the chain.

Elastos DID SDK提供通过RootIdentity生成的DID就是以DID Document形式呈现的，且是一个最简单的DID Document。

The Elastos DID SDK provides that the DID generated by root identity is presented in the form of DID Document, and it is the simplest DID Document.

如果想使DID Document内含更多信息，可以通过 DID Document Builder来操作，比如添加公钥，删除凭证等，最后通过seal操作得到想要的DID Document。

If you want DID Document to contain more information, you can operate it through DID Document builder, such as adding public key, deleting voucher, etc., and finally get the desired DID Document through seal operation.

DID Document内含验证方法，其包含的公钥就是验证方法的载体。DID可以拿着私钥对数据签名，同时通过DID Document里的公钥验证签名，以保证数据没有被篡改。

The verification method is contained in DID Document, and the inclusive public key is the carrier of it. DID can sign the data with the private key and verify the signature with the public key in DID Document to ensure that the data has not been tampered with.

DID Document必须含有一个主key，这个主key和DID字串之间是密码学可验证的。

DID Document must contain a main key, which is cryptographically verifiable with the DID string.

公钥用于数字签名、加密等操作，主要的目的是实现身份认证，或与服务端点建立安全通信。 此外，公钥也可用于DID授权和委托，并在DID CRUD操作中用来验证操作的合法性。

The public key is used for digital signature, encryption and other operations, the main purpose of which is to realize identity authentication or establish secure communication with service endpoints. In addition, the public key can be used for DID authorization and delegation, as well as used to verify the legality of the DID CRUD operation.

认证是实体可以通过加密方式证明他们与DID相关联的机制。 认证属性可以指定哪些DID的公钥可以被用来进行身份认证。

Authentication is a mechanism by which entities can prove that they are associated with DID by encryption. The authentication attribute can specify which DID’s public keys can be used for authentication.

授权是用于说明如何代表DID主题执行操作的机制。 委托是指DID主题可以授权他人代表他们行事的机制。 这对于DID密钥丢失情况下的DID安全善后事宜尤其重要，当主体不再能够访问其密钥或密钥泄露时，DID持有者授权的可信第三方可以声明停用该DID，从而禁止在密钥泄露的情况下导致的一些恶意行为。

Authorization is a mechanism for explaining how to perform actions on behalf of DID topic. Entrustment refers to the mechanism that DID topic can authorize others to act on their behalf. This is especially important for the DID security aftermath in the case of DID key loss. When the subject can no longer access its key or the key is leaked, the trusted third party authorized by the DID holder can declare to disable the DID, thus prohibiting some malicious behaviors caused by the key leakage.

亦来云DID的授权和委托仅支持必要的最小授权，即授权可信第三方用于停用目标DID，不支持其它操作。

The authorization and entrustment of Elastos DID only supports the necessary minimum authorization, that is, authorizing a trusted third party to disable the target DID, and does not support other operations.

除了发布身份验证和授权机制之外，DID文档的另一个主要目的是发布DID主题对应的服务端点 。服务端点可以表示主体希望通告的任何类型的服务，包括用于进一步发现，认证，授权或交互的分散身份管理服务。

Besides publishing authentication and authorization mechanism, another main purpose of DID document is to publish the service endpoint corresponding to DID topic. The service endpoint can represent any type of service that the principal wants to announce, including decentralized identity management services for further discovery, authentication, authorization or interaction.

出于安全的考虑，亦来云DID主题具有有效期，最长有效期可以设定为5年，用户也可以根据自身需求设定为更短的有效期。超出有效期的DID主题则会被DID解析器识别为无效DID主题。

For the sake of safety, the DID topic of Elastos has an effective period, the longest effective period can be set to 5 years, and users can set it to a shorter effective period according to their own needs. A DID topic that exceeds the effective period will be recognized as an invalid DID topic by the DID parser.

亦来云DID文档存储是基于ID侧链的，所以相关的操作都需要在支持ID侧链的客户端中操作。普通DID需要使用对应DID主题的认证公钥给自己发起交易来实现；自定义DID可以使用对应DID主题的公钥或者持有者的认证公钥来发起交易。但是普通DID停用例外，允许DID主题授权和委托的DID公钥发起相关操作。

Based on ID side chain, the operations related to Elastos DID document storage need to be operated in the client that supports ID side chain. Primitive DID needs to use the authentication public key corresponding to DID topic to launch a transaction for itself. Customized DID can use the public key corresponding to DID topic or the holder’s authentication public key to do the transaction. However, if the customized DID is out of service, DID topic authorization and entrusted DID public key are allowed to initiate related operations.
