# Create DID and DID Document

DID and DID Document are two different representations of the same object and are created at the same time - primitive DID is created by Root Identity. See the documentation of [Root Identity](../rootidentity/create-dids-from-the-rootidentity.md) for the method of creating DID in this fashion.
