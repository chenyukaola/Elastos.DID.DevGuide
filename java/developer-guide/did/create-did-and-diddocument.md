# Create DID and DIDDocument

DID 和 DIDDocument 是同一个对象的两个不同表现，并且同时被创建。普通 DID 都是通过 RootIdentity 创建，从 RootIdentity 创建 DID的方法参见 [RootIdentity 的文档](../rootidentity/create-dids-from-the-rootidentity.md)。

DID and DID Document are two different representations of the same object and are created at the same time. Primitive DID is created by Root Identity. See the documentation of Root Identity for the method of creating DID from Root Identity.
